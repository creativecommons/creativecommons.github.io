      <p>I began working at Creative Commons (CC) as the Full Stack Engineer this year
and it’s been amazing to get to work in the open at CC. But as someone who
has been working in closed, internal source environments for a very long
time it’s definitely been a learning experience and a perspective shift.</p>
<p>For years I benefited from, observed, and offered up personal work into the
world of open source, but I was never deeply involved in other projects in
a big way, nor was I able to contribute anything I did at my professional
day job back into the open source world (despite the benefit open source
afforded the work I did every day). It had been a hope of mine, something
I had advocated for, but had ultimately not worked out. Now at CC I
finally get to participate in projects that operate in the open, and a
larger community of contributors around the world.</p>
<p>It's been refreshing and rewarding, but it's also been enlightening. There's
so much that's different now. Working in the open doesn't just shift the
terms under which your code is licensed or how many people can contribute, it
requires a significant shift in both approach and process.</p>
<p>For example, working in the open means that while there may be community members
eager to contribute they may lack contextual understanding that someone more
intimately familiar with a project might develop over time and rely upon. To
support contributions well you need to have a heavily documentation-first
strategy that affords new contributors key information in understandable and
clear instructions.</p>
<p>That also means that documenting <em>issues</em> isn't just an item on a todo list
you'll get to later. There's extreme value in writing out detailed information
both for your future self, but also for any would-be community contributors to
understand the problem and address it. Setup instructions, contextual
documentation about the codebase, as well as detailed known issues, roadmaps,
etc. All of it needs to be documented and written out, which not only
benefits the community contributors, but also benefits the project as a
whole. It means key information has to live in the open alongside the code
it informs. It's truly a win-win all around.</p>
<p>The process also has to shift, you can't just make a list of things you want to
tackle and get to work, you have to consider how each item can be smoothly
adopted as granular and iterative Pull Requests that might all be worked on
by entirely different individuals. The level of care in how the work is
divided and scoped matters even more in this situation than it would have
with an internal team. Working in the open doesn't just mean coding in the
open, it also means planning in the open, and that means having a clearer
view on the overall roadmap and goals the project hopes to meet.</p>
<p>If you are the steward of a codebase any task list you create or <em>issues</em> you
identify are ultimately not just for you alone. Putting an item on your list
when you're working alone isn't enough, you've also got to find time to work
on that item, and work your way through completing it.</p>
<p>In the open source context, working with a community of contributors, creating
an <em>issue</em> is just as important and meaningful as writing code, in many cases
it might actually be MORE important. Because <em>issues</em> are often the way in 
which contributors first offer up help and insight, they're the first contact
they have with your project. Furthermore, any <em>issue</em> you create may end up
getting completed by one or more people that are not you, which means it
doesn't just sit on a list till you do it. It's a small, but significant
shift in how you think about planning and breaking down work on a codebase
in the open.</p>
<p>It’s certainly new, but incredibly rewarding. Even on days where I might not get
to submit a Pull Request myself, or squash a bug in a meaningful way, I can still
feel I offered up meaningful contributions to the community and the codebase
through better documentation, answering someone’s question, reworking a
process, or reviewing someone else’s generous contribution. Open Source means
opening up your definition of what contribution means, and it’s a lot broader
and more meaningful than I thought.</p>
