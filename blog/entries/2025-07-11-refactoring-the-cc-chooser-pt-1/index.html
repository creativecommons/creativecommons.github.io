<div><p>This blog is part one of a three part series: <a href="/blog/series/2025-chooser-refactor/">Refactoring and Releasing the 
new CC Chooser</a>.</p>
<p>We’re excited to announce that we have finally moved the Chooser from a 
long-term beta state into a finished and stable v1.0. But it certainly hasn’t 
been a straight-line. The Chooser has been met with a lot of challenges along 
the way and in this series we’ll walk through that journey in three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Part 1: History and debt: The historical context that led to the newest 
refactor and release of the 2025 Chooser.</li>
<li>Part 2: Specifics and fixes: Breaking down the specifics of technical debt, 
issues, complexity, contextual-shift misalignment, and fixes.</li>
<li>Part 3: Future Growth: What’s next for the Chooser, and what directions we 
hope to grow it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whats-the-chooser">What’s the Chooser?</h2><p>From our <a href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/">website</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our <a href="https://creativecommons.org/choose/">chooser</a> helps you determine which Creative Commons License is 
right for 
you in a few easy steps. If you are new to Creative Commons, you may also want 
to read licensing considerations before you <a href="https://creativecommons.org/choose/">get started with the 
chooser</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="circumstances-and-context">Circumstances and context</h2><p>What do you do when an ecosystem shifts, not just with the number of engineers, 
but also from the focal point of complexity built around a core product that no 
longer exists at an org? You evaluate the context within which everything 
exists and you reevaluate what works from there forward.</p>
<p>The Chooser has existed as a tool within the Creative Commons (CC) main website 
for over fifteen years, and helped guide countless people through their choice 
of sharing restraints and freedoms combined with which Legal Tool those 
requirements are best aligned with. In 2019 the Chooser was met with a need to 
refactor both its UX, and also its core technological approach. The CC 
Technology team was focused hard on CC Search, which would later launch in the 
Summer of 2019. CC Search was a rather complex application that required a more 
robust and dynamic user interface. It was in every way much more of an app than 
a website and so the team chose to build out the CC Search engine with Vue.js. 
Like the rest of the JavaScript ecosystem, this meant some speed and 
affordances in dev time with a trade off in larger code dependency and 
complexity; given the size of their team and the ecosystem they were seeking to 
build it was a solid and reasonable judgement call.</p>
<h2 id="building-an-ecosystem-from-a-strong-core-product">Building an ecosystem from a strong core product</h2><p>After landing on Vue and setting to work to build out the search engine, it 
became reasonable to also move as many other projects to the same ecosystem so 
that updates overall could better operate as a supportive ecosystem. If other 
websites and projects were moved to Vue, then they could share dependencies, 
benefit from fixes and updates, and as the CC Search engine grew it could have 
the delightful benefit of lifting up all the other projects along the way.</p>
<p>With a larger engineering team to manage the ecosystem it made a lot of sense 
(Node is sprawling, and can be overkill in the wrong circumstances). It 
decreased the complexity of managing a search engine, while adding some 
complexity to smaller projects, with the balanced gain of spreading updates and 
works across the whole a lot more cohesively. The end goal here was a 
development environment that was much less siloed and more responsibility 
consistent in how it approached dev work.</p>
<p>Vocabulary also entered the picture at this time. Its goal was to operate as a 
design spec and implementation “rule system” for the Vue framework 
implementation.</p>
<h2 id="shifting-circumstances">Shifting circumstances</h2><p>In 2020, Covid shocked our society, disrupted giving, and brought staff 
reductions to Creative Commons. Most of the Technology team was laid off. Work 
was mostly suspended, some projects were sunset, and others were left with 
minimal maintenance. Thankfully, CC Search was acquired and continued by 
Automattic as [Openverse][openverse]. However, with its absence came a rather 
large hole at 
the center of a very large development wheel.</p>
<p>Without the CC Search engine, now all the smaller projects which had adopted 
Vue would no longer receive the benefit of being attached to the larger 
project’s progress. Instead a balkanization began to unfold. The flexibility 
and scale that the Node ecosystem had offered when the CC Engine existed at the 
organization no longer applied, and now Node in all its forms within all the 
various projects were a liability instead of a strength.</p>
<p>Node is a fast moving system, and without a larger team it was difficult to 
keep dependencies updated, tested, and secure. Projects began to drift away 
from each other. Some projects still utilized Vue, others only halfway, and 
others abandoned in-progress migrations to Vue, instead falling back to what 
they had been doing before. The ecosystem fragmented and technical debt began 
to accrue. Since Vue (and by proxy Node/NPM) moves so quickly–the debt 
accrual was considerable.</p>
<h2 id="the-2020-chooser-in-limbo">The 2020 Chooser in limbo</h2><p>The 2020 Chooser, left with minimal maintenance, was a beta version. It was 
revamped and rebuilt to focus on the latest legal tools, offer a better UX, and 
incorporate the Vocabulary design system. It was built from the ground up 
entirely within Vue. And so the Chooser largely stayed, mired in beta due to an 
ever increasing amount of technical debt. The rest of the world was moving from 
Vue 2 to Vue 3, but there wasn't capacity at CC to update the Chooser.</p>
<p>By 2023, the Technology team had the capacity to begin reducing technical debt. 
Later that year the main CC site redesign was launched. That work cleared the 
way for redoing the Vocabulary design system, removing Vue, and simplifying its 
approach to be better scaled to a more concise set of engineering resources. 
The new site better utilized native WordPress functionality and minimized 
JavaScript (it did not use Vue or any other JavaScript framework).</p>
<h2 id="laying-groundwork-for-a-refactor-and-release">Laying groundwork for a refactor and release</h2><p>A lot of time had passed since its original beta redesign and 2020 beta 
release. The scope of the Chooser needed to be reconsidered. The core of its 
functionality needed to be narrowed back down to manageable goals, decision 
pathways, and stable long-term engineering.</p>
<p>In 2025, the Chooser was updated to better align with both the larger CC dev 
ecosystem and the capacity of the Technology team. These changes have resulted 
in a Chooser that is more integrated, balanced, stable, and viable long term.</p>
<h2 id="moving-forward">Moving forward</h2><p>In the next part of this series we’ll walk through the technical debt the 
Chooser had accrued, and the specific improvements and changes that we’ve 
implemented!</p>
