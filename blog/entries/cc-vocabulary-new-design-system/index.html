<div><p>With the development period of GSoC 2019 well under way, a number of new and
improved Creative Commons apps are navigating their way to production and
worldwide reception. With all this development comes one obvious challenge:
<em>consistency</em> (not to mention a number of other challenges such as
internationalisation and modularity).</p>
<p>The idea of a design system, to have a collection of elements and components
designed cohesively to be used across the body of applications of a particular
brand, is not new or even remotely my original. In fact, every organisation with
more than one application should have a design system. My last project was
backed by its own component library and it saved my team countless hours of
bikeshedding and repetitive design iterations.</p>
<p>Contributing to CC Search in the period before GSoC made me realize the numerous
areas of the project that would benefit from a pre-built library and prompted
the proposal that eventually became my project. I'll cite the same example that
I used in my proposal because it so clearly shows a problem and its solution.</p>
<p>Consider for example the header and footer. All CC apps have a header and a
footer developed along the lines of <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">the
homepage</a>, albeit to varying extents. However, due
to the lack of a common component, every app develops its own and they end up
looking like these. Calling them inconsistent would be an understatement.</p>

<small class="muted">The footer in the CC Search app</small>
</div><div>
<img alt"CC GitHub" src="cc_github.png"/><br>
<small class="muted">The footer on the CC Open Source site</small>
</div><h3 id="enter-cc-vocabulary">Enter CC Vocabulary</h3><p>CC Vocabulary solves precisely that. It is a set of components, elements and
patterns that unite Creative Commons' applications in terms of look and feel,
while encapsulating and abstracting basic functionality that need not be
reinvented per-app.</p>
<p>Now CC Vocabulary provides a footer (ready to use today!) that can be used on
all three of the above sites, conveying the same information in the same
consistent layout.</p>
<p><em>"What about the different contents in the footers?"</em>, you ask.</p>
<p>As for the different content in all three footers, the third column is 100%
customisable. So whether crediting the developers of the website, attributing
the icon artists or licensing the content therein, the footer just works. And
when it comes to translations, Vocabulary has you covered. Lastly, to embody the
colorful world of creativity, every CC Vocabulary component can be colored. So
from the blue header of CC Search to the orange one on the homepage, there's a
component for everybody.</p>
<p>'Nuff said.</p>

<p>Let's get to the nerdy stuff, the <strong>development details</strong>. Here's the good, the
bad and the ugly of Vue development and also how all three adjectives fail to
embody the one constant feeling: <em>challenging</em>!</p>
<h3 id="the-good">The good</h3><p>As you've already seen, the prospects of the library in making the CC codebase
modular, cleaner and i18n-ready are huge. And being written in Vue has a ton of
perks, not the least of which is a future-ready, progressive framework to back
the project!</p>
<p>Working in JavaScript is very different from a Python project. For instance, I
had literally very little need for Docker containers in the first place as npm
modules are local unlike pip, which needs Pipenv or similar to add sanity to
package management.</p>
<p>Development in Vue is even more different, and even even more so when building a
Webpack-based app with Vue CLI, which takes a different approach compared to
React CRA. For one, there is no option to eject! So any changes to the Webpack
config have to be submitted via an object in <code>vue.config.js</code> and deep merged
with the existing config.</p>
<p>Then there are plugins. Plugins for Vue CLI are few and far in between but those
that are work extremely well and integrate with the Vue UI, a web based
management tool for Vue projects. Both Vue Styleguidist, the plugin used to
generate the styleguide and Vue i18n, the plugin used to provide translations
work seamlessly with Vue and, with the exception of having to manually enable
i18n in Styleguidist by extending the renderer in <code>styleguide.config.js</code> (more
on that later), with each other.</p>
<p>Coming from a React background, the helpfulness of the Vue framework contrasts
starkly with the cold stony world I was accustomed to. <em>"I'm beginning to enjoy
JavaScript"</em>, a sentence I never thought I'd say.</p>
<p>So by the end of week one, I had a styleguide with a Heading component and a
Docker setup to boot. I also had a ridiculously large smile from all the
learning that I did. By the end of three weeks, I was the proud developer of a
world-class web component framework that was beginning to have some real
footing, something I had not even dreamed possible!</p>
<p><strong>Pro-tip:</strong> If you haven't seen or experienced Vue UI, you should. It will
change your opinion of Vue for the better, as it did mine.</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="o">[</span>user<span class="w"> </span>cc-vocabulary<span class="o">]</span>$<span class="w"> </span>vue<span class="w"> </span>ui
</pre></div>
<h3 id="the-bad">The bad</h3><p>In week 2, I had to develop a number of components and incorporate design
tokens, a practice with origins at Salesforce. Folks wiser than myself at
Salesforce came up with the idea of using design tokens to keep constants out of
the design and frontend development process, abstracting the actual nitty gritty
of colors and border radii behind semantic names such as <code>blue_light</code> and
<code>radius_small</code>.</p>
<p>Hardcoding every single color and every single dimension in YAML files manually
from little to no reference at all was a very low point in an already low week.
The reason behing this pain is <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/colors">CC's color
palette</a> which provides all values
in hex <code>#abcdef</code> for the close to forty colors in the palette. Were they HSL
values, it would have been extremely easy to shade the colors. If any brand aims
to redo its colors, I would suggest using HSL wherein HS is used to determine a
color and L is varied to determine its shades.</p>
<p>Another strange decision taken by Vue is that Vue components use a Single File
Component scheme making use of <code>.vue</code> files that Webpack processes using the
<code>vue-loader</code> package. Now Styleguidist and Vue i18n both add their own tags to
the mix such as <code>&lt;docs&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;i18n&gt;</code> making one component file go to hundreds
or even thousands of lines! In a world that taught us to decouple style from
functionality, this mushing of languages did not sit too well with me and I kept
contemplating what reasons would have prompted the developers to take this step.</p>
<p>Also Styleguidist comes with a very bland default style so to make it barely
presentable, one needs to override a lot of CSS styles that have absurdly high
specificities. Thankfully the default design is bland, not ugly otherwise the
whole thing would have been an ugly, miserable affair.</p>
<p><strong>Pro-tip:</strong> This catastrophe could have become ugly were it not for the
benevolent <code>src</code> attribute supported by some Vue tags. I had known this for
merely seconds when I found myself breaking my components down using</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">style</span> <span class="na">scoped</span> <span class="na">lang</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;stylus&quot;</span> <span class="na">src</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;./Component.styl&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class="nt">style</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>to store CSS separately and</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">i18n</span> <span class="na">src</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;./Component.json&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class="nt">i18n</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>to keep translations outside of my code, thus making the file much more
manageable. There is still no way to split the JS <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> from the HTML
<code>&lt;template&gt;</code> without losing all autocompletion features provided by the IDE.</p>
<h3 id="the-ugly">The ugly</h3><p>Incorporating translations into the project was the weirdest. With two or three
commands maximum, the Vue website had translations enabled and was working
perfectly. But the Styleguide would <em>just not render translations at all!</em></p>
<p>It took close to three days to even figure out why. Once I misinterpreted the
cause of the error, broke the entire styleguide and had to</p>
<div class="hll"><pre><span></span><span class="o">[</span>user<span class="w"> </span>cc-vocabulary<span class="o">]</span>$<span class="w"> </span>git<span class="w"> </span>reset<span class="w"> </span>--hard<span class="w"> </span>HEAD
</pre></div>
<p>to even get things to work. <em>"Use VCS."</em>, proved one again.</p>
<p>Finally I had to register the i18n plugin separately for the styleguide, install
the middleware on all components and add a locale selector to every preview box
across the styleguide by extending and overriding the preview component. The
good folks at Styleguidist had provided for that functionality, and it revealed
itself to me as I was at the very brink of losing my mind.</p>
<p>To add insult to injury, translations have to be done by hand. I know this is
how the world of i18n works but it would be really magical if we had a service
to do the translations automatically. Now I can write in two languages, and will
translate components to the other one as best as I can. But I urge you to
<a href="https://github.com/creativecommons/cc-vocabulary">contribute</a> too. Together we
can make CC components globally local.</p>
<p>Languages that follow an alternate orientation, such as top-to-bottom or
right-to-left would pose significant difficulty to implement, having to manually
render everything in an opposite or perpendicular direction gives me the chills.
It's gonna be ugly.</p>
<p><strong>Pro-tip:</strong> I learned that flags are a terrible way to represent language. Many
languages are spoken more widely outside countries of origin (think English) and
many countries are home to several languages (think India). Many large websites
make the mistake of using flag alongside language names and that seems so stupid
in retrospect.</p>
<p>Also one should use the native name of the language in the selector (like हिन्दी)
and the universal translation icon (or some stylistic variant thereof).</p>

<img alt="Translate icon" src="translate.png" height="48px"/>
</center><hr>
<h3 id="tl-dr">TL;DR</h3><p>The project which takes out a lot of the hard work from frontend
development has its fair share of hard work cut out for itself. The challenges
ahead are plentiful, but the solutions they inspire are diamonds in their own
right. It is safe to say that I can attribute my complete understanding of Vue, i18n,
component libraries, styleguides and design systems to CC Vocabulary.</p>
<p><em>Before we move on, let me tell you the bad and the ugly are not the norm. The
good was the major portion of the project.</em></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="future">Future</h3><p>So as you can see CC Vocabulary represents a huge leap forward for the
web-facing Creative Commons. I can't wait to see the new generation of apps by
Creative Commons, <em>powered by CC Vocabulary</em>.</p>
<p>CC Vocabulary is out now, with its code, design and translations on GitHub and a
live styleguide hosted on GitHub pages. Please <a href="/cc-vocabulary/">check it
out</a> and join the discussions.
Since it is too early to even call it a beta, your feedback is crucial in shaping
its future and with it, the future of all Creative Commons apps.</p>
<p>Here's a sneak peek!</p>
