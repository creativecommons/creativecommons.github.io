<div><p>In engineering, in programming, in coding–in building anything that intersects 
with a human and a computer, context matters. It controls how a variable is 
scoped, how a function is called, and how styles in a CSS file might cascade 
and apply.</p>
<h2 id="context-matters">Context matters</h2><p>As the saying goes, "Context is everything". But despite that, it can be easy 
to miss or ignore context, to skim past it when encountering issues, when 
hunting for problems.</p>
<p>So much of the engineering world is building things, moving things, refactoring 
things. It's a lot of activities that look and behave a lot like creating, but 
in equal measure a vast majority of roles and jobs in the field are about finding 
problems, whether by intention or accident.</p>
<p>It's why we have "Issues" in code repositories, the name alone signifies that 
something is amiss. An expectation was not met, a small part of this does not 
easily align with that.</p>
<h2 id="pause-for-compassion">Pause for compassion</h2><p>Finding problems is as much the momentum of engineering as anything else, and 
once encountered, the problem begs for the next part; finding a solution.</p>
<p>It is here at this transition, at the border, that I would invite you to pause. 
To step back and reconsider the problem you've just witnessed, the thing that 
is amiss and possibly blocking the work you are doing in some way.</p>
<p>For it is here in this space, between problem-encountered, and solution-sought 
that we all could do better at exercising a degree of compassion.</p>
<p>This problem was, in many ways, born out of the context within which it was 
first introduced. It may have been the after effect of an unrealistic 
timeline, or an unintended consequence of decisions made well outside the 
control and influence of the engineer that introduced it. It may have been 
put there, with full knowledge of its existence, but without any ability 
to circumvent its inclusion.</p>
<p>The problem in question is not necessarily the product of one person, one team, 
or one process. It is, as is usually the case, the outcome of an 
interconnected and complex system of people and technology interacting and 
influencing one another.</p>
<p>It can be easy to lean into the gravity of assuming this problem was easy to 
avoid, that it is a sign of poor decision making, or outright malice. That it 
is specifically indicative of someone or someones' shortcomings in the field. 
But engineering as a space of people is a place that can at times be a list 
of limited options, and the correct choice is not the one with zero 
problems, but the one that is accomplishable with the least problems, or 
even the least negatively impactful problems.</p>
<p>Moreover, despite rigorous reviews and tests, things get missed, circumstances 
change, and given enough time the complex system we all work within has fault 
lines. Problems arise that no-one expected or anticipated.</p>
<h2 id="without-context-assume-the-best">Without context assume the best</h2><p>Context is key, but it is also often a mystery. In the case of an inherited 
system, you may be left with the problems, but little if any evidence of the 
context in which they were generated. You are left with the duty to seek 
solutions, and little reason as to why the problems were introduced in the 
first place.</p>
<p>In all of these moments, we would all do better to remember compassion, to try 
to embrace that we do not know the full picture, the entire context. And that 
perhaps those before us, and around us did the best they were capable of within 
the system they were a part of.</p>
<p>It is certainly easy to jump to conclusions, lay blame, and cast judgements at 
the engineers, coders, tinkerers, and builders that came before us. "Why would 
they do it like this?" "This is a mess!" "I don't understand what this is 
doing here?" It's fair to be frustrated, and reasonable to question the 
"why", but a bit of compassion goes a long way towards building a community 
of trust and well being within the larger system of building things on and 
around the internet.</p>
<h2 id="safe-to-learn-and-safe-to-improve">Safe to learn and safe to improve</h2><p>Without compassion in these cases, we can foster an environment where people 
are afraid to make any mistakes. One major issue with this is that beginners, 
being beginners, make a lot of reasonable mistakes, and if they do not feel 
safe to make those mistakes then the arena of open source loses beginners, 
and without that it does not flourish, it does not thrive.</p>
<p>People, and the technological systems we create are imperfect. And the way we 
keep improving those systems isn't by solving coding problems alone, 
especially if those solutions don't come with a degree of compassion.</p>
<p>So, consider for a moment the next time you encounter a problem, pause for a 
moment and try to have some compassion, to put yourself in the place of the 
coder who came before, and then move on to seeking solutions with a degree of 
understanding across time that while we may not meet each other or share the 
same context; perhaps both of us were trying to make things a little bit 
better in what we did, and in the end we did our best to keep the system 
improving, code moving, and trust growing.</p>
