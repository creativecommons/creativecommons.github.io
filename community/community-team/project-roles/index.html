</ul>
<p><strong>Guidelines for Project Maintainers</strong></p>
<p>Being a Project Maintainer comes with a larger set of responsibilities and
guidelines, documented below:</p>
<h3 id="responsibilities">Responsibilities</h3><p>As a Project Maintainer, your responsibilities are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Review pull requests (PRs):</strong> You are expected to review incoming pull
requests regularly (we aim to review all pull requests within <a href="/contributing-code/pr-guidelines">within three
business days</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Decide on Community Team applications:</strong> You are expected to make the final
decision on Community Team applications for your project.</li>
<li><strong>Communicate with the applicant and the Open Source Community Coordinator
(OSCC) promptly:</strong> You are expected to reach out to applicants for Community
Team directly and let them know the status of their application.<ul>
<li>We want to get back to applicants within seven business days of
application, if possible. If this is not possible, you should reach out to
the applicant just letting them know that it’s taking a little longer than
usual (could be due to internal discussion taking a while, other things
taking precedent, etc.), and that we’re working on it.</li>
<li>You are expected to communicate with the OSCC promptly (within three
business days) when they reach out to you about a new Community Team
application or other related matter.</li>
<li>You should also notify the OSCC of your decision about the Community Team
application.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Let contributors know about Community Team:</strong> If you notice a strong
contributor, you should notify them of the existence of Community Team,
provide them with the link to the Community Team page on the CC Open Source
site, and encourage them to apply.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="reviewing-community-team-applications">Reviewing Community Team Applications</h3><p>Applications for Community Team roles will be sent to you individually by the
Open Source Community Coordinator (OSCC). The OSCC has ensured that the bare
requirements for the position are met. If bare requirements are not met, you
will be notified how so when you receive the application from the OSCC.</p>
<p>From here, you should review the application and the applicant’s contributions
based on the evaluation criteria. As a maintainer, you have a significant
amount of discretion here. If an applicant meets the requirements, but you do
not think they are ready for the role they’ve applied for, you can choose to
grant a role with fewer privileges, or not grant a role at all.</p>
<p>No matter the decision, you should do the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Notify the OSCC of your decision. Please include the applicant’s name, the
role they applied for, and if they applied for a project based role, the
project they applied to. From here, the OSCC will help coordinate permissions
and role management.</li>
<li>Notify the applicant of your decision. If you choose to grant them the role
they applied for, then send a congratulatory message. If you choose to not
grant them the role at all, or to grant one with fewer privileges, you should
construct some brief feedback as to why their application was denied, either
in part or in full. There’s a template for this type of feedback available in
the Community Team Google Shared Drive that you have access to.</li>
<li>Respond promptly to nominated “Great Contributions” and applications for
roles once they make their way to you. We would like to target seven business
days or less from time of application to time of decision, but this is
somewhat flexible.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="additional-notes">Additional Notes</h3><p>All Community Team work is done on a volunteer basis. Team members may pick up
tasks and help out here and there if they would like, but they should not be
expected to use all of their privileges all the time.</p>
<p>You have a big license for discretion within the Community Team. All applicants
for all roles will need to be approved by you personally, and you may choose to
deny an application based on subjective criteria even if the applicant meets
the hard requirements.</p>
<p>Here are some other miscellaneous things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Issue submission requirements are org-wide, but PR requirements are not.
Applicants should be submitting PRs for the repo they are aiming to get
privileges for.</li>
<li>If two repos are closely related to each other (ex. catalog and catalog api),
or if work in repo X also regularly includes work in repo Y, project
maintainers can collaborate to grant roles to a contributor in both repos at
once.</li>
<li>Project Maintainers may opt out of granting roles depending on the nature of
the repository.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a maintainer, you have the ability to make some repository-specific
allowances. These include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Issue and PR requirements can vary by repository depending on traffic. If a
maintainer wants to mandate different numbers for their repository, they
should state these requirements in the repo’s README.</li>
<li>Maintainers may expand on what is counted as a “Contribution” if there is
some type of work specific to that repository.</li>
<li>Specific privileges may be granted per-repo by maintainers depending on the
type of work taking place in that repo (ex. Issue research in cccatalog).</li>
</ul>
