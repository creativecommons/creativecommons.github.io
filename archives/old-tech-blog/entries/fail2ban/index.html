      <p>When I started at CC a number of years ago and began having to review <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/logwatch/">Logwatch</a> output on a daily basis, I tired quickly of the massive list of failed SSH login attempts in the log output. I care much less about who failed to login than who actually did log in. So the first thing I did was to reduce the verbosity of the SSH filters for Logwatch by creating the file <code>/etc/logwatch/conf/services/sshd.conf</code>, and added only "<code>Detail = 0</code>" to it. However, I still found it annoying to have thousands of failed login attempts on virtually all servers. Granted, I wasn't really worried that anyone would get in by trying to brute-force a login. It was a more a matter of principle, and also a small bit that every failed login attempt uses some tiny amount of resources that could better be used for legitimate traffic. So I implemented connection rate limiting via Netfilter. However, that didn't work for our then software engineer <a href="http://asheesh.org">Asheesh</a>, who generally has around 30 open terminals and as many SSH connections to remote hosts, and who was hitting the rate connection limit. So he started using the <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/speed-multiple-ssh-connections-same-server">ControlMaster</a> feature of SSH to get around this limitation. Some time later I removed the rules altogether with the idea that they weren't doing anything useful, and were probably detrimental because the kernel was having to inspect a bunch of incoming packets and track connections. Also, at that same time Asheesh recommend that I use a program called <a href="http://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">fail2ban</a> instead of tackling the issue with Netfilter. I didn't like the idea. Something seemed hackish about inserting Netfilter rules via some daemon process that scrapes log files of various services. I also am an advocate of running as few services as possible on any given server; the less that runs, the less chance that something will fail in a service-impacting way. Then, the whole thing fell into the forgotten, until a few days ago.</p>
<p>A few days ago I was looking over the Logwatch output of our servers, as I do ever day, and was offended to find that on one server in particular there were nearly 30,000 failed SSH login attempts in a single day. Sure, in terms of network traffic and machine resources, it's just a drop in the bucket, but it aggravated me. I revisited the idea of fail2ban and did a bit more research. I came to the conclusion that it was pretty stable and worked really well for most people. So I decided to install it on one server. I was really happy to find that it was as easy as <code>apt-get install fail2ban</code>. Done! On Debian, fail2ban works for SSH out-of-the-box, and I didn't have to do a thing; just another testament to the awesomeness of package management in Debian. I was so impressed that I went ahead and installed it on all CC servers. It has been running nicely for about a week, and failed SSH login attempts are now reduced to a few dozen a day on each machine. Are the machines more secure? Probably not. But it's just one of those things that makes a sysadmin happy.</p>
